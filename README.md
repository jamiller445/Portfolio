This is my portfolio pagae.  I showcases a few of the web applications that I have created.  
To access an application listed on the Portfolio page mouse click on the screen capture of the application.

Here are brief descriptions of each application:

GifTastic  -  Giphy api.

Word Guess  -  The theme for this word guess game is dog breeds.  JavaScript is used to create a key event
               listener to process the letters entered from the keyboard.  As the letters are entered they 
               appear in the blank spaces of the word.  Game feedback to the player includes number of guesses 
               remaining, score in wins and losses.

Crystal Collector  -  Another guessing game based on numbers.  Each round of the game will have a different set of values                               assigned to the crystals.  A player clicks on a combination of crystals to sum the values to match the 
                      target number to guess.  This is an application that demonstrates the creation and setting of element attributes with javascript jquery.

Trivia Time  -  A web software development trivia game that demonstrates the use of javascript jquery and the use of 
                timers and javascript objects.  The round of the game runs for a specified time interval and a set timeout is 
                used to time a players response.
